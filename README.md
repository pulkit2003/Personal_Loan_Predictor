# Personal_Loan_Predictor
Hi!
This is a Machine learning-based Python Project.
It uses different Machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression to get the output.
This project focuses on getting input sample data from Kaggle and working on it to determine whether the customer will get the loan.
I hope you like it.
